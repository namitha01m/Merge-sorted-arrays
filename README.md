# Merge-sorted-arrays
Two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 needed to be sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

# Time complexity
O(m+n) m and n are lengths of two arrays.  The complexity is because the program iterates through both arrays once and the number of iterations is proportional to sum of (m+n)

# Space complexity
O(1) because the merging operation takes in-place, without using any additional data structures that scale with the input sizes.
